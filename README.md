1. Reads data from X-ray afterglow luminosity light curve
2. Defines model: ejecta energy variation with time assuming energy injection (from Simone Notebook)
3. Fits model to the data and compute best fit param and cov. matrix
4. Plots best fit model on data
5. Saves plot in ../output

Per lanciare lo script: 
ipython --pylab
run loglumfit
